# Data Sources

### dragraceR

-   This is a cool library a friend of mine Jessica ([github](https://github.com/jalavery), [twitter](https://twitter.com/jessicalavs)) came across, containing three data sets:

    1.  rpdr_contep: Contestant performance at the Episode level

    2.   rpdr_ep: Episode level

    3.  rpdr_contestants: Contestant level

### [Data for Progress](https://www.dataforprogress.org/) 

-   A Progressive policy and polling organization. They ran a contest that challenged teams to build a model to accurately predict the winner and loser of each episode. This is outside the scope of my project.

-   They gathered [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sotvl3o7J_ckKUg5sRiZTqNQn3hPqhepBSeOpMTK15Q/edit#gid=228427306) through season 10 and made it publicly available:

    1.  all_episodes: Episode Level

    2.  all_contestants: Contestant Level

    3.  all_rankings: Ranking of each contestant in each episode

    4.  all_social_media: Scrape of contestants social media follower counts (not complete)

# Motivation

-   The data sources above complement each other. I will use them to demonstrate my ETL skills.

-   By the letter:

    -   **E :** Extract data from a library (not difficult) and googleSheets

    -   **T :** Transform during the extraction and follow a data model that allows for joining

    -   **L :** Load the final dataframes into and RSQLite database

-   I have significant experience in database management and will be creating an RSQLite database that will be stored in this repository. I chose this route over using AWS because this project will be converted into a library.

    -   If this weren't open source I would write all data into S3 and load into Redshift database
